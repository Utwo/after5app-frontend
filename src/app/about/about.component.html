  <p>We are a group of students from Cluj-Napoca passionate about Computer Science. Not only once did it happened to us
    to have a great new idea about a website or an app that we would like to implement but we didn’t have enough
    knowledge or working experience.</p>
  <p>Gradually, we found out that we were not the only ones in this situation, that there are many people and students
    around us that are full of creative ideas but they just lack certain technical skills. For example they know how to
    deal with the backend of an application, but they just need a frontend expert and a designer who can help them
    present their idea to the world. </p>
  <p>Thus, we found this need in our community and we came up with the idea of this website. A place where people could
    present their ideas and write a short description about the kind of help they need, so other passionate and talented
    people could join them on this journey and make it happen. </p>
  <p>We want to encourage collaboration and change. We don’t want ideas to <span class="text-muted">fade</span> away.
